# 🌌 Chaotic-Orbits: A Python 3-Body Problem Simulator

This project simulates the **three-body problem** using **Python**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**, applying the **Runge-Kutta 4th Order Method (RK4)** for numerical integration. It visualizes gravitational interactions and highlights the chaotic nature of multi-body systems.

## 🔭 What is the 3-Body Problem?

The **three-body problem** models how three celestial bodies move under mutual gravitational attraction. Unlike two-body systems, which are predictable and solvable analytically, **three-body systems exhibit chaos**—tiny changes in starting conditions result in dramatically different outcomes. No general closed-form solution exists.

> “This problem puzzled minds like Newton, Euler, and Lagrange for centuries.”
